# Python_punya_class 

This is a space for me to learn python. I created this  page to complete a task from Ju Ping to create a music genre guessing game, I have completed the challenge and the coding can be found from the file `Music_genre_ajim.py`.

To run the program one can simply open the file `Music_genre_ajim.py` and copy the code and paste it on Visual Studio Code software. For those who do not have it can simply go to any python editor online such as [PYnative](https://pynative.com/online-python-code-editor-to-execute-python-code/).
